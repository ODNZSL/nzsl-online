# Ignore changes to the dictionary SQLite file. Because git treats
# SQLite as a binary format, every change to this file stores a new copy of the
# file. We update the dictionary file each time bin/setup or rake
# dictionary:update is run, and automatically download the latest version when
# we start deployed dynos, so we don't need to track changes to this file in the
# repo
