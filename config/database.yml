  # Set the DB pool size
  #
  # This config assumes we are using a process forking app server like Unicorn.
  # If this app ever moves to Puma then this calculation should change.
  #
  # DB_POOL
  #     Environment var that we can manually set in the Heroku config if we want to
  #     override the pool size for any reason.
  #
  # WEB_CONCURRENCY
  #     Environment var that Heroku sets automatically based on Dyno size. While we
  #     technically can override this in the Heroku config we probably
  #     shouldn't - the preferred way to customise the DB pool size is to use
  #     DB_POOL above.
  #
  # The built-in default pool size is 5.
  #
  # We add 2 to the WEB_CONCURRENCY because we want enough connections
  # available to be able to run things like `rails console` without impacting
  # the worker processes.
  #
  pool: <%= ENV["DB_POOL"] || (Integer(ENV.fetch("WEB_CONCURRENCY", "3")) + 2) %>
