    # This application has multiple DNS names for historical reasons. For SEO
    # and effective CDN caching purposes we want to have just one canonical DNS
    # name but we also cannot break existing links which might use the other
    # names.
    #
    # Traditionally this problem would be solved via URL rewriting in
    # Apache/Nginx/Varnish etc. but that is not possible because we are hosted
    # on Heroku.
    #
    # The `rack-canonical-host` middleware allows us to solve this problem in
    # Rails. It redirects requests for non-canonical domain names to the
    # canonical domain name.
    #
    # `Rack::Sendfile` is the first middleware in the Rails middleware stack
    # (run `bundle exec rails middleware` for details) so we are inserting the
    # Rack::CanonicalHost middleware right at the start. This means we don't
    # waste time processing a request which will be redirected by
    # Rack::CanonicalHost anyway.
