2,Origins of NZSL,1,"<p>Historical evidence about the earliest use of NZSL is sketchy, but recent research shows that it is closely related to British Sign Language (BSL) and Australian Sign Language (Auslan). Apparently, BSL found its way to New Zealand with immigrants from the United Kingdom during the nineteenth century (Collins-Ahlgren 1989; Dugdale 2000), and it is likely that a distinct variety of NZSL began to develop among the pupils of the first residential school for the Deaf which opened in 1880 at Sumner, Christchurch. Two subsequent residential Deaf schools in Auckland and Feilding also brought together Deaf children from preschool through to highschool age, forming networks that developed into adult communities.</p>

<p>The first century of Deaf education policy in New Zealand (1880-1979) did not allow sign language in classrooms, and Deaf children received a strong message that signing was an improper way to communicate in public. Nevertheless, generations of Deaf children covertly used and created signs to communicate with each other within schools, and later in adult contexts. In 1979, Australasian Signed English was adopted as part of a Total Communication approach in Deaf education. Use of this sign system introduced many new signs (mainly from Auslan) into the NZSL community during the 1980s.</p>

<p>Research on natural signed languages and Deaf cultures began to positively impact the NZ Deaf community in the mid 1980s. From this time, the local sign language was researched, documented in dictionaries, and named as &lsquo;NZSL&rsquo;. In the decades since, Deaf New Zealanders have assumed a more positive sense of ownership of their language and asserted a Deaf cultural identity. NZSL was accepted for use in Deaf education from 1993. In 2006 it was legally recognised in the <a href=""http://www.odi.govt.nz/what-we-do/nzsl/index.html"">NZSL Act</a> as an official language of New Zealand.</p>

3,Variation in the lexicon,3,"<p>NZSL has some variation in the vocabulary used by different groups of people. The original schools for the Deaf enrolled the full spectrum of children: boys and girls, Pākehā (European) and Māori, and from a wide geographical area. As a result, most of the vocabulary in NZSL is common to all members of the Deaf community. However, there are marked differences in the vocabularies of older and younger signers, mainly due to the introduction of Australasian Signed English from 1979. Many signs used in this system quickly moved into wider circulation in the NZSL community, particularly among the generations educated after 1979. There are also some regional (north, central, south) differences in the signs that are favoured for certain concepts, but research has found few signs are completely unique to any one region.</p>

<p>Some social networks or groupings have sign vocabularies that they tend to use within their own particular contexts&ndash;such as Māori, church congregations, rugby players, teenagers, fishermen. The full extent of this type of specialised vocabulary is not yet fully captured in the dictionary.</p>

5,Alphabet,,"<p>Fingerspelling is a way of representing written English words within sign language through a manual alphabet. NZSL uses the two-handed British manual alphabet. In NZSL, fingerspelling is mostly used for proper nouns (names of people and places), and sometimes for terms for which there is no established sign equivalent. As a general rule, NZSL signers prefer to express referents by signs rather than fingerspelling, if a sign is available.</p>

<p>Fingerspelling in NZSL is used more by younger Deaf people than by older generations, because fingerspelling was not present (either formally or informally) in New Zealand schools until after 1979. Many Deaf senior citizens in New Zealand do not use fingerspelling at all; instead they may trace letters in the air with the index finger, or use lip-patterns and/or voice to convey an English word. The use of fingerspelling in NZSL appears to be currently increasing, particularly as NZSL becomes more commonly used in educational and professional contexts that involve contact with written and spoken English. Within the Deaf community, competence in fingerspelling may vary according to an individual&rsquo;s English Literacy and their sign language acquisition background.</p>

<p>The two-handed manual alphabet is shown here from the signer&rsquo;s own point of view (looking towards the palm of the hands), and from a viewer&rsquo;s perspective - looking at another signer&rsquo;s hands. Signers usually simultaneously mouth the word as they fingerspell it, normally articulating the syllables as they are spelled out rather than individual letters.</p>

6,Numbers,,"<p>Many numbers have alternate or varying forms in NZSL. Variation in numbers is linked to age, region, and personal preference of signers. New (Auslan) numbers were introduced into schools with Australasian Signed English in 1979, which differed from the number signs used by earlier generations.</p>

<p>NZSL has several systems that incorporate number in which a number sign has a distinct movement and/or location including:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href=""#cardinal"">Cardinal Numbers</a> (counting)</li>
	<li><a href=""#ordinal"">Ordinal Numbers</a> (ordering: 1st)</li>

</ul>

<p>Most of the signs in this dictionary are &lsquo;frozen&rsquo; or established signs; that is, they are formed and used in predictable ways. But the lexicon of NZSL is greatly expanded by the flexible combination of certain handshapes and movements to represent objects, actions, and visual properties of things and situations. These more creative sign formations are found in most natural signed languages, and they are known as &lsquo;classifiers&rsquo; or productive lexicon. Because the exact form and meaning of such signs is specific to a particular context of use and therefore variable, they cannot be recorded as regular entries in the dictionary.</p>

<p>Classifier signs describe and/or represent a noun by depicting its semantic or visual features. For instance, objects that are flat and round (eg, a coin), straight and thin (eg, a picture frame), or spherical (eg, the earth) are represented by handshapes that are manipulated in space to represent a feature of the object&rsquo;s appearance, size and location. Instrumental or handling classifiers represent how an object is used, with the handshape reflecting something about the object&rsquo;s shape or how it is held, and the movement showing how it is used (eg, unscrewing a lid or turning a knob).</p>

<p>Certain classifier handshapes represent closed semantic categories, such as &lsquo;vehicle&rsquo;, or &lsquo;person&rsquo;, and these are also used like a pronoun that can be moved to incorporate a verb of motion and location. For example, a flat open handshape with the blade down represents a vehicle, and can be moved in an upward-sloping, zig-zag motion to express &lsquo;a car driving up a steep winding road&rsquo;. These complex classifier constructions that incorporate an entity and an action are also known as &lsquo;pro-forms&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Number and quantity is expressed in some classifiers by a change or reduplication of handshape; eg, three upright fingers moving forward, rather than one, can stand for three persons walking, or two hands can be used to arrange multiple objects in space - eg, two palm-down claw handshapes side by side can represent two or more houses next to each other. Often, two hands are used simultaneously in classifier constructions, with each hand representing parts of the same entity, or two different entities that relate to each other in space (eg, a car parked under a roof, a bird on a rock, two people sitting opposite, a train entering a tunnel).</p>

<p>Classifiers are a productive source of new vocabulary creation in signed languages, as they can be used to represent new nouns (eg, <a href=""/signs/5581"">mobile phone</a>), activities (eg, <a href=""/signs/6066"">bungy-jump</a>), and other concepts. Many signs in the established dictionary lexicon that reflect shape or action originate in classifiers, such as <a href=""/signs/834"">table</a>, <a href=""/signs/3846"">hammer</a>, <a href=""/signs/5666"">plate</a>, <a href=""/signs/2974"">jump</a>, <a href=""/signs/2461"">meet</a>, <a href=""/signs/2405"">assertive</a>.</p>

9,Purpose of the Dictionary,1,"<p>The Online Dictionary of NZSL is a multimedia digital resource designed for use by learners and teachers of NZSL, Deaf people, families and associates of Deaf people, interpreters, researchers, and public agencies, among others. The dictionary is a reference tool that allows users to search for NZSL vocabulary through either English / Te Reo Māori&nbsp;words or by the visual features of signs themselves.&nbsp; Te Reo Māori translations have been added to each entry, making the dictionary accessible in three languages.</p>

<p>Dictionary users are bound to find some gaps for concepts that are not yet included, because the documentation of NZSL remains a work in progress. As with any language, NZSL vocabulary constantly changes and grows in response to the experiences of the language community. This online format will allow for the dictionary to be updated more readily than in the past.</p>

<p>An online dictionary provides information about the lexicon or words of a language, and creates an historical record of its development through time. However, it is not designed to be a stand-alone tool for teaching, learning or translating NZSL. These activities require more extensive and structured exposure to &lsquo;live&rsquo; use of NZSL, supported by reference to the contents of the dictionary.</p>

14,About the Entries,2,"<p>
	The dictionary contains approximately 4,000 entries for NZSL signs. Where a single sign has two distinct senses, each meaning has a separate entry. Each entry shows a sign as a line drawing, as a videoclip, and as used in an example sentence. The sign is translated with equivalent English words - usually a main gloss, and secondary or other possible meanings. Both main and secondary English glosses are included in a sign search.</p>
<p>
	All the sentence&nbsp;examples reflect natural&nbsp;NZSL usage, and the structure&nbsp;of the signed sentence is represented in a literal gloss displayed below the videoclip. Notice that each written&nbsp;sign gloss in a sentence can be clicked to link to the entry for that sign within the dictionary. An English translation of example sentences is provided to show the meaning and grammatical context for using the sign.</p>
<p>
	Drawings and video clips will be the most important way for learners to see how to make a sign. But some entries also contain a &lsquo;hint&rsquo; that helps to remember the way a sign looks, based on a visual aspect of the sign.</p>
<p>
	All signs are indexed to a topic, which allows users to look for signs according to a topic area: <a href=""/signs/search?tag=5"">actions</a>, <a href=""/signs/search?tag=18"">emotions</a>, <a href=""/signs/search?tag=20"">family</a>, <a href=""/signs/search?tag=23"">health</a>, <a href=""/signs/search?tag=22"">politics</a>, <a href=""/signs/search?tag=39"">time</a>, for example.</p>
<p>
	Entries contain grammatical information about how a sign is formed and used, including the following: its main grammatical role in NZSL (verb, noun, adjective, pronoun, interrogative, etc); whether it can be made in varying locations or directions to express spatial information, or moved in varying directions to show person (agent-recipient) meaning; whether a two handed-sign is optionally made with one hand; whether a sign can be modified to show adverbial meaning (such as manner), or to incorporate number meaning.</p>
<p>
	Information about the origin and the users of particular signs is shown in some entries. Where this information is known (not in every case), origin of a sign is noted (for example, within NZSL or adopted from Auslan, BSL or ASL). Certain signs are known to be used more by one generation than another, in which case the entry will indicate &lsquo;older&rsquo; or &lsquo;younger&rsquo; use.</p>
<p>
	A small number of signs are marked as <a href=""/signs/search?usage=1"">archaic</a> or <a href=""/signs/search?usage=5"">rare</a>, meaning that they are no longer, or very infrequently, used. Other signs that have been recently coined (sometimes for specialised or educational purposes) and are not yet in widespread use are marked as <a href=""/signs/search?usage=2"">neologisms</a>. Signs that are regarded by the NZSL community as <a href=""signs/search?usage=3"">obscene</a>, or as <a href=""/signs/search?usage=4"">informal</a> slang, are marked as such.</p>",,10,2011-09-26 00:22:49.317564,2011-10-30 23:19:54.043103

	<a name=""archaic"">Archaic</a></h3>
<p>
	Archaic signs are no longer in common use.</p>
<h3>
	<a name=""dominant_hand""> Dominant hand</a></h3>
<p>
	A signer&rsquo;s stronger hand, usually their writing hand. One-handed signs are made with the dominant hand. In two-handed signs where the handshapes differ, the dominant hand often has a more complex handshape or movement.</p>
<h3>
	<a name=""is_fingerspelling""> Fingerspelling</a></h3>
<p>
	This sign includes one or more letters of the fingerspelling alphabet. See <a href=""/alphabet"">alphabet</a> tab.</p>
<h3>
	<a name=""inflection_manner_and_degree""> Inflection: manner and degree</a></h3>
<p>
	The facial expression and/or movement of this sign can be changed to show how an action was performed and differences in intensity.</p>
<h3>
	<a name=""inflection_plural""> Inflection: pluralisation</a></h3>
<p>
	The movement of this sign can be repeated to show that there is more than one thing, animal or person.</p>
<h3>
	<a name=""inflection_temporal""> Inflection: temporal</a></h3>
<p>
	The movement of this sign can be changed to show differences in the duration or regularity of the action.</p>
<h3>
	<a name=""informal""> Informal</a></h3>
<p>
	These colloquial signs are mainly used in informal situations, usually between signers who know each other well.</p>
<h3>
	<a name=""mouth_pattern""> Mouth pattern</a></h3>
<p>
	Many signs, especially nouns and verbs, can be accompanied by silent mouthing of a spoken word that corresponds to the sign meaning. Some signs are formed with specific movements of the lips, tongue and mouth that are not related to speech, but contribute to the meaning of the sign.</p>
<h3>
	<a name=""neologism""> Neologism</a></h3>
<p>
	Neologisms are signs that have only recently come into use and may not be known by the whole NZSL community. Many neologisms have developed in educational settings.</p>
<h3>
	<a name=""non_dominant_hand""> Non-dominant hand</a></h3>
<p>
	The signer&rsquo;s weaker hand, usually their non-writing hand. In two-handed signs where the handshapes differ, the non-dominant hand usually has a less complex handshape and movement than the dominant hand.</p>
<h3>
	<a name=""non_manual_signals""> Non-manual signals</a></h3>
<p>
	Movements of the eyebrows, eyes, mouth, cheeks, head and upper body that add grammatical meaning to a sign or phrase.</p>
<h3>
	<a name=""contains_numbers""> Number incorporation</a></h3>
<p>
	The handshape of this sign can be changed to a number handshape (usually from 1-5, occasionally from 1-9) to show how many items or people are involved. See <a href=""/numbers"">numbers</a> tab.</p>

51,Is there a Māori sign language?,2,"<p>
	People often wonder, &ldquo;Is there a Māori Sign Language?&rdquo; To answer this question, it is important to understand that sign languages develop in communities of Deaf people who share the common experience of being excluded from the spoken language communities around them. Natural sign languages do not originate from, nor match, a spoken language &ndash; they have an independent structure and system of meaning based in the visual experience of Deaf people. &nbsp;NZSL is the common language that has developed over many generations of Deaf people from Māori, Pākeha and other ethnic backgrounds in New Zealand. There are signs in NZSL that express Māori cultural experience and referents, and this vocabulary is expanding as Maori Deaf people gain more access to Māori contexts through the use of NZSL. So, while some people refer to these concepts as &ldquo;Māori signs&rdquo;, there is no distinct &ldquo;Māori Sign Language&rdquo;. Spoken Te Reo Māori can be interpreted into NZSL (Te Reo Turi), and vice-versa &ndash; translating from the sense and structure of one language into the sense and structure of the other.</p>

52,Te Reo Māori translation for headwords,1,"<p>
	During the past year,&nbsp;Māori translations for each headword (main English meaning) have been added to the dictionary, so the meaning of NZSL signs can be found through both English and Māori. Work on this project&nbsp;was funded by a grant from Ma Te Reo, a fund administered by&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.tetaurawhiri.govt.nz/maori/index.shtml"">Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Māori </a>(the <a href=""http://www.tetaurawhiri.govt.nz/english/index.shtml"">Maori Language Commission</a>), and by <a href=""http://www.vuw.ac.nz"">Victoria University of Wellington.</a></p>

	NZSL Online in its new form&nbsp;was officially re-launched by Victoria University, <a href=""http://www.deaf.co.nz"">Deaf Aotearoa New Zealand&nbsp;</a>and Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Māori during NZSL Week in May 2013.&nbsp;</p>
